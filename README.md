AI-Generated Text Detector


An AI-generated text detector in SML project helps to identify whether the text or paragraph was written by a human or copied or inspired by an AI engine. The fundamental idea includes creating a detector on text features that compares the AI-generated content from human-written content.

The basic steps include the:
1.)Data Collection: In this step we collect a dataset with labeled examples of both human-written and AI-generated text.
2.)Feature Extraction: Extract features from text that may help identify AI generation.
3.)Model Training: Use a machine learning classifier (like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or a neural network) to train on these features.
